## How I started

Originally, I just watched a bunch of youtube videos and copied what was being taught. Then i chose to do a program called SheCodes. I choe to do the basics which were HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I didn't finish and I should have. MAtter of fact I will finish the javascript portion. I still to this day watch videos and read over materials. I had a hardtime with problem solving. Problem solving in the tech industry is a little different from the medical industry. But I have hope i will learn the concepts and get better at my problem solving.
